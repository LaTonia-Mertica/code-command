        <strong>AND SO WHAT'S WITH THE CONFETTI</strong>
        <br />
        Things happen all the time that we need to celebrate. Some thing that
        makes us smile to ourselves. Other things that draw attention. Whether
        wanted or not. From others who smile for and with us. Big things. Maybe
        moreso not-so-big things. Yet still never insignificant. Toss confetti
        time is simply recognition that while life may be a challenge, there are
        things along the way we should pause to admire. Tossed symbolically -
        such as in words. Or literally. Without worry about boasting. Or risk of
        ever tossing too much. I'm constantly tossing mine. Toss yours.
        <br />
        <br />
        Completing the self assessment is a good opportunity. Too is each task
        you conquer along the way. .. toss YOUR confetti.
